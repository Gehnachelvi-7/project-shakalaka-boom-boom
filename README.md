 WEEK 1
Learned Python basics: arrays, functions, numpy, pandas, matplotlib. Explored supervised/unsupervised ML and deep learning fundamentals.

 WEEK 2
Introduced to OpenCV, trained CNN models, implemented activation functions (ReLU, tanh, sigmoid), and explored overfitting/underfitting.

 WEEK 3
Focused on Data Augmentation, Transfer Learning. Built classifiers for CIFAR100, pneumonia vs. normal detection, and compared CNN vs. MLP on fashion-mnist.

 WEEK 4
Developed hand tracking using OpenCV and mediapipe. Implemented brightness control, drag-and-drop functionality based on hand gestures.

 WEEK 5
Integrated hand gestures for screen pausing/resuming. Explored functionalities using numpy and math libraries for image manipulation.

 WEEK 6
Completed a comprehensive project integrating OpenCV, mediapipe for hand tracking, TensorFlow for digit prediction, and audio/visual control using wmi + comtypes.
